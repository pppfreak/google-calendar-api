Demo Project for Google Calendar API Using Spring Boot Rest API with OAuth2

This guide shows you how to build a sample app doing various things with "Google APIs" using OAuth2 and Spring Boot. It starts with a simple, single-provider single-sign on, and works up to a self-hosted OAuth2 Authorization Server with a choice of authentication providers (Fitbit or Facebook or Github). The samples are all single-page apps using Spring Boot and Spring OAuth on the back end. They also all use AngularJS on the front end, but the changes needed to convert to a different JavaScript framework or to use server side rendering would be minimal.
